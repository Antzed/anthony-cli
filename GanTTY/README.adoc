_Project planning from the terminal_

image::gantty_demo.gif[GanTTY demo]

GanTTY is yet another project that I would consider a proof of
concept, it is far from being a full feature project managing
tool, but it has pretty colours so...

=== Dependencies

```
python3
stty
```

A terminal that supports Unicode and ANSI escape codes.

=== Running

Clone the repository, go into the folder and execute `main.py`

```
git clone https://github.com/timeopochin/GanTTY.git
cd GanTTY
python3 main.py
```

=== Usage

File::
* `q` to quit
* `W` to save

Navigation::
* `h` and `l` to pan backwards and forwads in time
* `J` and `K` to pan down and up
* `g` and `G` to pan to the top and bottom
* `j` and `k` to select next and previous task
* `w` to toggle view between days and weeks
* `H` and `L` to grow and shrink the left margin

Tasks::
* `a` to add a new task
* `n` to rename a task

* `D` to delete a task
* `<space>` to toggle a task's status
* `d` to select a task's dependencies
* `+` and `-` to increase and decrease a task's length

=== TODOs

Urgent new features::
